        <h2>Color Hex</h2>
        <h4>Project: App Inventor Project</h4>
        <h3>During this project, my partner and I developed an interactive, user-friendly application using MIT App Inventor. 
        As we collaborated in the coding, documentation, and testing process, the two of us brainstormed new ideas and created more updates for our game.
        We alternated roles between writing the actual code for the mechanics, score, and design as well as recording our daily progress. With a 
        duration of approximately two weeks, this project consisted of one beta gallery walk and one final gallery walk to incorporate others' feedback to
        improve our project. The objective of Color Hex is to move the multi-colored square in order to let the ball fall into the section with the same color.
        Once the user is taken to the main screen, the ball will change into one of the four colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and gradually move down. The user
        may utilize the arrow keys on the device in order to rotate the square and will score points if they do this successfully. If the ball fails to touch
        the correct colored section, the game will be over. There are unlimited rounds. Throughout the course of this assignment, I worked on the majority of the
        documentation and testing along with assisting with the code.</h3>

         <h2>Harry Potter vs. Death Eaters</h2>
         <h4>Project: Scratch Project</h4>
        <h3>In this project, I developed an original multi-level game based off of the events in the popular Harry Potter series along with my partner.
        For the duration of a little bit over one week, the two of us collaborated and communicated, each playing major roles in the creation
        and documentation of the application. We used the website Scratch in order to write the code and create the design for our game. The 
        main objective of Harry Potter vs. Death Eaters was to play through the four levels with increasing levels of difficulty in order to
        defeat the death eaters, restore peace, and vanquish Voldemort's evil forces from the Wizarding World. Using the keyboard's arrow keys,
        the user would be able to maneuver Harry around the screen and cast spells by pressing the space button. Each energy ball/spell that hit
        the death eater for that stage would earn the player one point. After each level, the speed of the spells and villains will increase.
        The score and amount of lives are recorded on the menu at the top of the screen, and if the user fails to win against their opponent
        they will be taken to a Game Over screen. Throughout this project, I contributed in the graphics, code, and took note of our progress.

         <h2>Snapshot Photobooth</h2>
         <h4>1.4.7 Image Manipulation Project</h4>
        <h3>Throughout this project, my partner and I worked on creating various image manipulations for family portraits in order to satisfy our client, a family. 
        After brainstorming ideas and sketching our designs, we began uploading images of family members and searching for methods, classes, and attributes that we 
        would need during the coding process. During the two weeks we had to work on this project, the two of us communicated effectively and worked efficiently, each
        of us playing a crucial role in the project's development and collaborating to fix problems or errors in the code. Although we initially had problems with 
        figuring out how to paste images onto another image and writing a for loop to allow the code to run for an entire directory, we referenced past assignments 
        and consulted one another to make it work. At the end of this project, we had a gallery walk where we received teacher and peer feedback about the pros and cons.
        The main piece of feedback we received was to add a color option for our black and white images. Our final product was a modified, black and white image with
        a geometric border, personalized images including things they liked and their names, and our company's icon on the bottom right corner. We successfully got our
        code to execute for any images under a directory, and it would move these newly modified images to a "modified" directory. During this project, I worked on
        the documentation, and I wrote the code for pasting images, resizing images, and the for loop for images under a directory. By working together with my partner,
        I learned how to effectively save images and files to another directory and write code for the python PIL.Image module.
