        <h2>App Inventor Project</h2>
        <h3>During this project, my partner and I developed an interactive, user-friendly application using MIT App Inventor. 
        As we collaborated in the coding, documentation, and testing process, the two of us brainstormed new ideas and created more updates for our game.
        We alternated roles between writing the actual code for the mechanics, score, and design as well as recording our daily progress. With a 
        duration of approximately two weeks, this project consisted of one beta gallery walk and one final gallery walk to incorporate others' feedback to
        improve our project. The objective of Color Hex is to move the multi-colored square in order to let the ball fall into the section with the same color.
        Once the user is taken to the main screen, the ball will change into one of the four colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and gradually move down. The user
        may utilize the arrow keys on the device in order to rotate the square and will score points if they do this successfully. If the ball fails to touch
        the correct colored section, the game will be over. There are unlimited rounds. Throughout the course of this assignment, I worked on the majority of the
        documentation and testing along with assisting with the code.</h3>

         <h2>Scratch Project</h2>
        <h3>In this project, I developed an original multi-level game based off of the events in the popular Harry Potter series along with my partner.
        For the duration of a little bit over one week, the two of us collaborated and communicated, each playing major roles in the creation
        and documentation of the application. We used the website Scratch in order to write the code and create the design for our game. The 
        main objective of Harry Potter vs. Death Eaters was to play through the four levels with increasing levels of difficulty in order to
        defeat the death eaters, restore peace, and vanquish Voldemort's evil forces from the Wizarding World. Using the keyboard's arrow keys,
        the user would be able to maneuver Harry around the screen and cast spells by pressing the space button. Each energy ball/spell that hit
        the death eater for that stage would earn the player one point. After each level, the speed of the spells and villains will increase.
        The score and amount of lives are recorded on the menu at the top of the screen, and if the user fails to win against their opponent
        they will be taken to a Game Over screen. Throughout this project, I contributed in the graphics, code, and took note of our progress.
